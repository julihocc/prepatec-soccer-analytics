Generate a comprehensive tag description for a new version of the repository [repository-name], with the tag name [version-number].

The description should be automatically generated by analyzing the Git commit history between the last version tag ([last-version-number]) and the current HEAD. The analysis should categorize changes into new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes by following the Conventional Commits specification.

Once the description is generated, create an annotated Git tag with this information, tag the current HEAD, and push the new tag to the origin remote.
