Generate a comprehensive tag description for a new version of the repository [repository-name] with the tag name [version-number]. The description should be automatically generated by analyzing the Git commit history between the last version tag ([last-version-number]) and the current HEAD. The analysis should categorize changes into new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes by following the Conventional Commits specification. The final output must be a well-formatted string suitable for an annotated Git tag message.
